# thedreamwriters.github.io: Codex Vitae
<blockquote>“And this is the other treasure. Following in the Founder’s footsteps, every member of this fellowship produces his or her own codex vitae, or book of life. It is the task of the unbound. Fedorov, for example, is one of these. When he is finished, he will have poured everything he has learned, all his knowledge, into a book like these.” - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008FPOIT6/">Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore: A Novel</a> by Robin Sloan</blockquote>

This Codex Vitae, or "book of life", is a collection of my beliefs and concepts that inform my decisions and life. It is a work in constant flux; as my understanding changes, so will my beliefs. The main purpose of this document is to (1) pull my beliefs into the light where I can questions them more effectively and (2) to share philosophies, concepts, tools, and inspiration that have been helpful to me.


## How to Use This Codex ##

### If you are Emma Hryniewicz/The DreamWriters: ###

- Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that develop throughout the year.
- Consider doing a monthly review of whether my life is in alignment with values and beliefs. If not, should my behavior change or have my understanding and values changed?
- Do a yearly review in April of the entire document, editing places where beliefs have changed. Expect beliefs and tactics to change— don’t hold on to them too rigidly.

### If you are not Emma Hryniewicz/The DreamWriters: ###

- Read this with the understanding that you are different than Emma Hryniewicz — the way they lives their life is not the way you should live yours.
- Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that is helpful.
