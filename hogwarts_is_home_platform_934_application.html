<li><b>What HP character do you identify with most and why?</b>
This has changed over the years, but for the last six or so years it's been Neville Longbottom, initially a side character who lacks confidence and drive (and appears to have dyspraxia!), but through the power of integrity and supportive community/staff (first Dumbledore's Army under Harry's tutelage, then later with various teachers -- some with ulterior motives depending on if you're talking Movieverse or Bookverse), and finds that he's powerful and bright in his own right with the right focus and supports, and he becomes an ESSENTIAL member of plot relevance and leadership!
  
Like Neville, I've always struggled with self-confidence, motivation, and agency. It's not that I'm lazy or stupid (though I've been called both!), it's that I have a lot of processing and mental health issues! I discovered recovery-oriented services in fall of 2011, three years after I was diagnosed with several mental health and learning disabilities in college and struggled to get social supports in my community community. I tend to jokingly refer to the Boston University Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation's Recovery Education Program as "my Dumbledore's Army," since it's the place where I've finally found a place where I'm supported to grow and learn and I feel more successful. 
  
  <li><b>What one moment in the books was the most meaningful to you?</b> 
    
Kinda in line with the previous question, it was Neville's successful expelliarmus and the awe of "HEY LOOK I DID IT!" in Dumbledore's Army when he took advantage of Harry being distracted. Neville tends to be the butt of almost every neurodivergency joke until this point in the series and it shows that WITH support and encouragement, he's not as stupid as everyone and he himself seems to think.
